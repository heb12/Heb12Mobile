## December 26th, 2023
I know the last release was almost 5 years ago, and I said this app wouldn't get any more updates... but I still use it,
so here's a few minor bug fixes. Keep in mind I wrote this when I was 14-15 years old. The code is poor. It's glitchy.
The whole thing was hacked together until it worked. And it does work.

The Play Store and F-Droid listings will probably go defunct. I might list it on my own Google Play account (requires change in package name)
but most likely I will just upload a new APK for anybody wanting to get a slightly fixed version.

Heb12 Mobile is a free mobile open-sourced app for reading the Bible. It currently features 5 translations (soon to be more) and a clean, simple, and efficient UI.

The app originally started on May 2nd, 2018 as a simple demo in MIT's App Inventor. It was later re-written in HTML5 so it could be portable and easier to modify.

Heb12 Mobile is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3.0+.
