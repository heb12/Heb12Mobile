Heb12 Mobile has officially recieved its last update as of March 13th, 2020.  
After over a full year of constant development, it is now legacy code and will

development in the coming months. Find our progress here: https://code.heb12.com/

Heb12 Mobile is a free mobile open-sourced app for reading the Bible. It currently features 5 translations (soon to be more) and a clean, simple, and efficient UI.

The app originally started on May 2nd, 2018 as a simple demo in MIT's App Inventor. It was later re-written in HTML5 so it could be portable and easier to modify.

Heb12 Mobile is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3.0+.
